**Learning Docker**

**Docker Dreams: A Modern Ode**

I wandered lost in dev’s domain,
With broken scripts and server pain.
Then Docker came—so crisp, so clean,
A box for code, neat and serene.

No setup fights or tangled threads,
Just tidy files and sleeping sheds.
Compose arose, with power grand—
One file to rule, one line command.

Though errors struck and builds did fail,
Each fix became another sail.
Now here I chart what I explore—
A Docker tale, forevermore.
